This code creates a 256x256 procedurally generated city based on Eixample, Barcelona. This program was run on Python 3.6.

The required modules are listed in requirements.txt

This script works combined with the [Minecraft HTTP Interface Mod](https://github.com/nilsgawlik/gdmc_http_interface).
Follow the installation instructions in the above github file to install the mod and the Forge Mod launcher which are required to run our code.

After a succesful installation the city can be spawned by running the main.py file in a terminal window while logged in to minecraft.
